# Space Frame System 

## intro
**Octriads** are a very simple spaceframe system I discovered/invented several times through my life. 
The context kept changing. With each decade and fresh iteration, I was srtuck by new themes, forms and geometric relationships.
Octriads bubled up.. found fresh life and gave me inspiration.

As with so many personal design theme-form treasures, it began with folding paper, making ad-hoc models as a child.
Thes days it is called live coding. In my case it was live codeing3D ~paper scissors, folding, glue {maybe} 

An adult life-time of happy sketching on napkins, in not4ebooks, on 5x8  cards in cafes east and west..
For past 10 years I have been living in, and building out a small country home w/art studio.. 
At last space and time to explore these forms at larger scales. To apply them as architectural elements, as pragmatic and playful structural sapce-forms. As sculpture. And hooray -- now 3d ppinting arrives on Earth.

How lucky to be alive right now..
